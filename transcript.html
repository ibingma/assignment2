    <h1>Hi, my name is Ibing Maharlika.</h1>
    <p>This is the website that I built for COMP 2861 Assignment 2 titled "Layout Design for a Website".</p>

    <h2>Design Concept</h2>
    <p>
        The concept of this website is to demonstrate the use of CSS floats in web design. While the header image 
		  is not floated, all other elements are arranged using the floating method. The items in the horizontal navigation bar
		  are floated to the left, with their text centered.
        For the main body, I’ve created two floating columns: the self-portrait image on the left and the text on the right. 
		  These columns are displayed side by side using the float property.
        In the footer section, I’ve included several floating elements: a button to navigate to another page, a vertical 
		  navigation bar displaying social media icons and links, contact information, and a copyright statement. In this section,
		  however, the floating directions are mixed. This is due to the need of the design. For example, the copyright statement 
		  is floated to the left, while the navigation bar is floated to the right.
    </p>

    <h2>Design Ideas</h2>
    <p>
        The design process took quite some time. As this was my first experience building a website with HTML and CSS, 
		  I initially had no idea where to start. Before I could begin coding, I needed a design, which I found challenging.
		  I explored design inspiration on websites like Pinterest, Land-book, and Dribbble.com.
        After gathering ideas, I started sketching concepts in Figma, a design tool that is easy to use. Initially, 
		  I used a stock image from Pexels.com, but I wasn’t satisfied with the result. I then searched through my own
		  photo albums for self-portraits, and after trying a few, I found one that worked well with the design. 
		  I decided to go with this.
    </p>
    <p>
        This image of myself was taken not long ago. Since this is a personal website, I feel it fits the theme. 
		  I added a box-shadow effect to the picture’s border to create a floating appearance, which adds a nice visual touch.
    </p>

    <h2>Color Scheme</h2>
    <p>
        The color palette was derived from the image, where I selected contrasting colors, primarily dark and light tones.
		  I experimented with different combinations in Figma and, after some trial and error, I settled on a set of colors that
		  make the webpage look visually balanced and harmonious.
    </p>

    <h2>Typography</h2>
    <p>
        For typography, I chose the Roboto font, designed by Christian Robertson and available through Google Fonts. 
		  It is described as friendly, with open curves that create a welcoming feel. I found it ideal for a personal website,
		  as it provides a natural and relaxed reading experience that complements the overall design.
    </p>

    <h2>Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>
        I incorporated progressive enhancement, with the text sizing. The text size adjusts as the window is resized,
		  and I also set the font size to have a minimum and maximum size (I’ll demonstrate this by resizing the window).
		  However, when the window becomes too small, the image shrinks more than the text, creating an imbalance look. 
		  This issue is difficult to resolve with the floating system, and after researching online, I found that most people
		  recommended using Flexbox to solve it. Since I haven’t learned Flexbox yet, I’ll leave this issue for later.
    </p>

    <h2>Links</h2>
    <p>
        Four items in the horizontal navigation bar are active: the first links to this page, the second  to another page, 
		  the third to a how-to page, and the fourth to a transcript page. The image is also clickable, leading to the other page. 
		  In the footer section, I’ve included a button, which was part of the assignment requirement. It has a rounded border and 
		  links to the other page as well. Now, let’s proceed to the next page
    </p>

    <h2>Another Page</h2>
    <p>
        On the next page, I’ve detailed the design process for the 'About Me' section. Here, I used the grid layout, 
		  where the HTML code is divided into rows and columns. However, the horizontal navigation bar at the top still uses floats.
    </p>
    <p>
        The image here is several images stacked on top of each other, arranged using the CSS grid system. 
		  I can change the position of these images by adjusting the CSS code instead of using an image editor. 
		  The rest of the content is also placed in grid rows and columns. One of the images, specifically the font name image,
		  has a rounded corner border.
    </p>
    <p>
        The background image is a personal photo of the St. Lawrence River near Quebec City, featuring a scenic bridge.
		  I edited and tiled this image in Figma before embedding it in the HTML code.
    </p>

    <h2>Upload and Test</h2>
    <p>
        I have linked the steps for uploading and testing a website to one of the navigation bar links. While it's not required,
		  I decided to do it since there was extra space available, so I linked it to the main page. I haven’t tested these steps 
		  myself yet; I’ve simply gathered them from online resources.
    </p>

    <h2>Transcript</h2>
    <p>
        To utilize the fourth link in the navigation bar, I added a transcript page where everything that I just said is included here.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        In terms of web development, I found that the grid system is easier to implement than the float system, because the former 
		  provides more control over elements placement. However, the grid layout requires more complex HTML setup, which can be challenging
		  for beginners like me. Despite the difficulties, the design process was a valuable learning experience. I must admit that though,
		  I got really carried away with this assignment and ended up doing more than I needed to. However, it was a really great way
		  to understand how HTML and CSS work.
    </p>
    <p>Thank you very much.</p>
